# Image Classifier Project

Project code for Udacity's "Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow" Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

## Information to the project ##
The task was to build an image classifier with TensorFlow to classify the oxford flowers dataset. Therefore i used the mobilenet architecture from tensorflow hub and changed the classifying layer. The second task was to write a command line application for predicting new images.

## Explanation ##
There are the following files to use:
<ul>
  <li>Project Image Classifier Project.ipynb: This is the Jupyter Notebook i developed the code and trained the classifier. For submission a html-file is included. </li>
  <li>predict.py: The command line application for predicting new pictures. It is possible to choose the top k predictions for a picture.</li>
  <li>label_map.json: This file includes the class names for the flowers and the corresponding label numbers. </li>
  <li>test_images: Folder with some test images for inference.</li>
</ul>
